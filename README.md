# Horiseon Accessibility Refactoring

Web accessibility is an increasingly important consideration for businesses. This ensures that people with disabilities can access websites using different kinds of assistive technology. This also aides business by positioning sites in search engines such as Google, and to avoid litigation when people with disabilities cannot access the website.

This task is to refactor the company's website to aide in accessibility.

## User Story

* AS A marketing agency
* I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards
* SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines

## Criteria

* GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards
* WHEN I view the source code
* THEN I find semantic HTML elements
* WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
* THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
* WHEN I view the image elements
* THEN I find accessible alt attributes
* WHEN I view the heading attributes
* THEN they fall in sequential order
* WHEN I view the title element
* THEN I find a concise, descriptive title
